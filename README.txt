  About the 2048 game :
        2048 is a single-player puzzle game created in March 2014 by 19-year-old Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli, in which the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. It is a type of sliding block puzzle, and is very similar to the Threes app released a month earlier.[3][4] Cirulli created the game in a single weekend[5] as a test to see if he could program a game from scratch,[6] describing it as a clone of Veewo Studios' app 1024 and getting the idea from Sami Romdhana's clone 2048,[4] and was surprised when his game received over 4 million visitors in less than a week,[6] especially since it was just a weekend project.
